<h2> Hello, I am Ä°lker! </h2>
<p> I've been studiyning programming for 2 years. But I am doing it seriously for a year. I am a Highschool student. That's why I can not only focus on programming. I am not in a team yet. But I want to form a team in the future. <p>
  
<h2> What am I working/learning on? </h2>
<p> I enjoy working with <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>. I am using JavaScript to make a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> bot.<p>
  
<p> I am also learning HTML for programming a website. <p>
  
<p> Making games in also my interests. I am learning <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> to create my own game. I started learning pixel art to do my own game. <p>
  
<h2> What I want to do in future? </h2>
<p> -I want to develop my discord bot to share it on <a href="https://top.gg/tr">Discord Bots List</a>. <p>
<p> -Form a team for doing games and joining GameJams. <p>
<p> -Programming my own website. <p>
